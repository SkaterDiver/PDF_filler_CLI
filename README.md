# PDF_filler_CLI
Made a python CLI that takes inputted .docx files, parses them to look for words encapsulated in square brackets, then changes them to what the user enters and saves as a copy to pdf. Could be good for filling out CVs or a game of mad libs.

How to use:

1) install LibreOffice

2) Install dependency
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3) Run the CLI
`python cover_letter_cli.py`
